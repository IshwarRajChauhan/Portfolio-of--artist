    <p align="center"><b>Contemporary artist Amit Bhar melds realism and mysticism in his paintings, evoking a trance-like sense of calm and contemplation. Born in West Bengal and raised along the Hooghly river, he is deeply influenced by the beauty of nature and the charm of small town life. This fascination led him to his longtime muse — the sacred city of Varanasi and daily rituals along the Ganges. He captures sadhus on the ghats, iconic architecture, boatmen and women in pure white sarees in the water.

        The atmosphere in art by Amit Bhar is dreamy and meditative. The figures and buildings are highly detailed, yet the edges of the scene often fade into the sky, like a mirage. He explains, “I would like to think my paintings are a rendezvous for illusion and reality, that precise moment before you fall into a beautiful dream. My paintings, I would say are a melange of ancient Indian art with the modern world. I bring glimpses of innocent, hidden worlds, so full of vibrant colors and life.”
        
        Amit Bhar is a self-taught artist. He studied under gold medalist Shri Paresh Das and later under artists Niloy Ghosh and Subal Jana. He has exhibited widely across India as well as internationally in Singapore, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and the United States.
